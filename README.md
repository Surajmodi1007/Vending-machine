# Vending-machine

• Architected a sophisticated Vending Machine Controller with a focus on accepting coin inputs and autonomously 
   dispensing products upon meeting the specified deposit amount.
• Employed a Finite State Machine (FSM) methodology to intricately model the vending machine's behaviour, underscoring 
   a structured and systematic design approach.
